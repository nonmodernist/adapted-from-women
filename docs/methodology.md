**Project Methodology: American Women Writers in Hollywood Adaptation, 1910-1960**

This database documents American films adapted from the novels and short stories of American women writers between 1910 and 1960. The project emerged from a critical observation: as women were systematically excluded from directing roles in the Hollywood studio system, they maintained significant creative influence through literary adaptation. Many of these writers, despite their contemporary commercial success and cultural impact, have since been forgotten or marginalized in film history.

**Scope Boundaries**
The database is deliberately limited to:
- **American films**: Productions by American studios, focusing on Hollywood's treatment of domestic literary voices
- **American women writers**: Authors who were American nationals, ensuring a focused narrative about women's participation in their own national cinema
- **Novels and short stories**: Prose fiction that formed the backbone of studio adaptation practices
- **1910-1960**: A period spanning from the early silent era through the classical studio system, capturing the crucial decades when women directors disappeared while literary adaptation flourished

**Research Purpose**
By maintaining these boundaries, the project can:
1. Reveal patterns of which women writers Hollywood repeatedly turned to for source material
2. Document the indirect creative power women exercised during an era of increasing exclusion from production roles
3. Recover the reputations of forgotten women writers who significantly shaped American cinema
4. Provide concrete evidence of women's continued participation in Hollywood's creative economy despite systemic barriers

**Data Decisions**
Films falling outside these parameters (British productions, male authors, post-1960 adaptations, theatrical sources) are documented separately for potential future analysis. This separation preserves the integrity of the core dataset while enabling later comparative studies that might explore how adaptation patterns changed over time, differed internationally, or varied by source medium.

This focused approach prioritizes depth over breadth, allowing for meaningful analysis of a specific historical phenomenon: how American women writers influenced their national cinema during a transformative period in both literary and film history.
