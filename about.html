            <h2>The Hidden History of Women in Hollywood</h2>
            
            <p>Over the past seven years, what began as a simple spreadsheet grew into a mission: to document how American women writers profoundly shaped Hollywood cinema during an era when they were systematically excluded from directing roles. This database reveals a hidden creative pipeline where women's stories, characters, and perspectives reached millions of moviegoers through literary adaptation.</p>
            
            <p>Between 1910 and 1960, as women directors first flourished and then virtually disappeared from Hollywood, studios turned again and again to novels and short stories by American women writers. These adaptations weren't occasional—they were a cornerstone of the studio system. Yet today, most of these writers have been forgotten, their contributions to cinema erased from popular memory.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>This project is part of a broader feminist historiographical effort to recontextualize women's contributions to early cinema and classical-era Hollywood. While we often hear that women "didn't make movies" during the studio era, the truth is far more complex. Women contributed enormously as writers whose works provided the source material for hundreds of films. Some had their works adapted 10 or more times—they were household names in their day, yet are virtually unknown now.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Project Scope & Methodology</h2>
            
            <p>This database focuses specifically on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>American films</strong> produced by American studios</li>
                <li><strong>American women writers</strong> who were U.S. nationals</li>
                <li><strong>Novels and short stories</strong> that formed the backbone of studio adaptation</li>
                <li><strong>The years 1910-1960</strong>, from the early silent era through the classical studio system</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These boundaries allow us to trace clear patterns: which women writers Hollywood repeatedly turned to, how quickly their works were adapted, and how literary genres transformed into film genres. By maintaining this focus, we can provide concrete evidence of women's continued participation in Hollywood's creative economy despite systemic barriers.</p>

            <h2>Origins & Development</h2>
            
            <p>This project emerged from my research on Gene Stratton-Porter and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings for my dissertation. As I discovered Hollywood adaptations of their work, I began noticing a pattern—American women writers were everywhere in early Hollywood, yet their names had largely vanished from film history. What started as casual note-taking evolved into systematic documentation of this forgotten chapter of cinema.</p>
            
            <p>The database now lives on multiple platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supabase</strong> serves as the primary database</li>
                <li><strong>Python scripts</strong> enrich the data from sources like Wikidata and the AFI Catalog</li>
                <li><strong>This website</strong> makes the research publicly accessible and searchable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How to Use This Resource</h2>
            
            <h3>For Researchers</h3>
            <p>The database can be searched by film title, author name, year, genre, and more. Each entry includes available information about the film, its source work, and the author. Where possible, we link to the AFI Catalog and other authoritative sources.</p>

            <p>This is an active, growing resource. Current plans include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding at least 200 more films to reach comprehensive coverage</li>
                <li>Incorporating citations from contemporary trade publications</li>
                <li>Adding scholarly citations that discuss these adaptations</li>
                <li>Mapping women's involvement in other key roles (screenwriters, producers, etc.)</li>
